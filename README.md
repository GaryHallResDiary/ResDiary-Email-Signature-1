## How to generate html page preview link

1. Open the html file you want to view as a page in this project. Copy the URL from the browser.

2. Open <http://htmlpreview.github.io/> and paste the link.

## Already generated links

- [Latest email signature](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aurimas-resdiary/ResDiary-Email-Signature/blob/master/index.html)

## Structure

Use `index.html` for the latest email signature.  

When a new signature is done, put the older one inside `Archive` folder for easy access. As a general rule `Archive` folder has only decommissioned signatures.

If you have two versions of the latest signature, put the variant next to `index.html` with a suffix e.g. `index-rwg.html`.
